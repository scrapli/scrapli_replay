==============

this may work w/ older releases... just picked a version that is a few years old to use as the minimum version...
not putting this in requirements because it feels strange to do so? and its already in dev requirements so ci will be ok
pytest>=5.3.0,<7.0.0

TODO:
- make collector work w/ generic driver too
- tests
- docs
